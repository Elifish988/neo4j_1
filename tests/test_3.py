# Exercise 1: Factorial Calculation
# Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
# Test edge cases like 0 (factorial of 0 is 1) and negative numbers (should raise an exception).
def factorial(n):

# Exercise 2: Reverse a String
# Write a function that reverses a string. Test edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings.

# Exercise 3: Check Prime Numbers
# Write a function that checks whether a number is prime. Handle edge cases like negative numbers, 0, and 1.
def is_prime(n):

    pass

# Exercise 4: Flatten a Nested List
# Write a function that flattens a list of lists (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]).
# Handle edge cases such as empty lists and lists with only one element.
def flatten(lst):
    pass

# Exercise 5: Check for Palindrome
# Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
# Test with empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with spaces.

# Exercise 6: Sum of Positive Numbers
# Write a function that returns the sum of all positive numbers in a list.

# Exercise 8: Find Unique Elements in a List
# Write a function that finds all unique elements in a list.

# Exercise 9: Count Words in a String
# Write a function that counts the number of words in a given string.

# Exercise 10: Merge Two Sorted Lists
# Write a function that merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.
# Handle edge cases such as empty lists, one list being significantly longer, and lists with duplicate elements.
