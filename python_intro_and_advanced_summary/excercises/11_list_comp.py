# 3 Easy Exercises

# Exercise 1 (Easy): Convert Temperature List
# Explanation: Write a function `convert_temperatures` that takes a list of temperatures in Celsius and returns a new list with the temperatures converted to Fahrenheit using a list comprehension.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Temperatures in Fahrenheit: [32.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]


# Exercise 2 (Easy): Extract Even Numbers
# Explanation: Write a function `extract_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers using list comprehension.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Even Numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8]


# Exercise 3 (Easy): Clean Data Entries
# Explanation: Write a function `clean_entries` that takes a list of strings with leading/trailing spaces and returns a new list with all entries stripped of whitespace and converted to lowercase using list comprehension.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Cleaned Entries: ['data science', 'machine learning', 'ai']


# 2 Medium Exercises

# Exercise 4 (Medium): Normalize Data Points
# Explanation: Write a function `normalize_data` that takes a list of numerical data points and returns a new list with all points normalized to a 0-1 range using list comprehension.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Normalized Data: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]


# Exercise 5 (Medium): Filter and Transform Records
# Explanation: Write a function `filter_transform_records` that takes a list of tuples representing customer records `(id, name, age)` and returns a new list containing the names of customers who are at least 18 years old, in uppercase, using list comprehension.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Filtered Names: ['BOB', 'DAVID']


# 1 Hard Exercise

# Exercise 6 (Hard): Flatten and Process Nested Lists
# Explanation: Write a function `flatten_and_process_data` that takes a nested list representing sales data where each sublist is a list of sales amounts per day (e.g., `[[120, 150], [100, 200], [130, 170]]`).
# The function should:
# - Flatten the nested list into a single list of all sales amounts.
# - Filter out any sales amount less than 150.
# - Return a new list where each sales amount is increased by 10%.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Processed Sales: [165.0, 220.0, 187.0]
