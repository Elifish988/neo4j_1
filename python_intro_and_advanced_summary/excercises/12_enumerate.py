# Topic Recap: Enumerate (Data Engineering Oriented)

# 3 Easy Exercises

# Exercise 1 (Easy): Indexing Items in a List
# Explanation: Write a function `index_items` that takes a list of data entries and prints each entry along with its index using `enumerate`.
# Solution:

# Example Output:
# Index: 0, Entry: Data Engineer
# Index: 1, Entry: Data Scientist
# Index: 2, Entry: ML Engineer
# Index: 3, Entry: BI Specialist


# Exercise 2 (Easy): Enumerate with Custom Start Index
# Explanation: Write a function `list_projects` that takes a list of project names and prints each project name with a custom starting index using `enumerate`.
# Solution:

# Example Output:
# Project 1: Customer Segmentation
# Project 2: Sales Forecasting
# Project 3: Anomaly Detection


# Exercise 3 (Easy): Enumerate for Data Validation
# Explanation: Write a function `validate_data` that takes a list of data entries and prints a warning message for each entry that is an empty string, along with its index, using `enumerate`.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Warning: Empty entry found at index 1!
# Warning: Empty entry found at index 4!


# 2 Medium Exercises

# Exercise 4 (Medium): Enumerate for Data Transformation
# Explanation: Write a function `transform_data` that takes a list of numerical data points and transforms them into a dictionary where each key is the index and each value is the squared value of the data point.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Transformed Data: {0: 4, 1: 9, 2: 25, 3: 49}


# Exercise 5 (Medium): Enumerate and Filter Data
# Explanation: Write a function `filter_data_by_index` that takes a list of data points and filters out data points where the index is even using `enumerate`.
# Solution:

# Example Output:
# Filtered Data: [15, 25, 35]


# 1 Hard Exercise

# Exercise 6 (Hard): Data Processing with Enumerate
# Explanation: Write a function `process_sales_data` that takes a list of sales amounts and applies the following rules:
# - For sales amounts at even indexes, apply a 10% discount.
# - For sales amounts at odd indexes, apply a 15% surcharge.
# Return the new list of processed sales amounts.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Processed Sales: [90.0, 230.0, 270.0, 460.0, 450.0]
