# 3 Easy Exercises

# Exercise 1 (Easy): Sum of Even Numbers
# Explanation: Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number using a `for` loop and the `range()` function.
# Guidance: Use the `range()` function with a step of 2 and `in` operator to iterate over even numbers only.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter a number: 10
# Example Output:
# Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10: 30


# Exercise 2 (Easy): Multiplication Table
# Explanation: Write a program that prints the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) for a given number using a `while` loop.
# Guidance: Use a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and print the multiplication result.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter a number for the multiplication table: 5
# Example Output:
# 5 x 1 = 5
# 5 x 2 = 10
# 5 x 3 = 15
# ...
# 5 x 10 = 50


# Exercise 3 (Easy): Search for an Element
# Explanation: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and a target number, and checks if the target number is in the list using a `for` loop and `in`.
# Guidance: Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list elements and use `if` to check if the target is found.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter a number to search for: 6
# Example Output:
# 6 is in the list.

# Exercise 4 (Medium): Prime Number Checker
# Explanation: Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it's a prime number using a `for` loop and `else`.
# - If the number is prime, print "Prime".
# - If not, print "Not Prime".
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter a number to check if it's prime: 17
# Example Output:
# Prime


# Exercise 5 (Medium): Skipping Specific Numbers
# Explanation: Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20, but skips numbers divisible by 3 using `continue`.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20


# 1 Hard Exercise

# Exercise 6 (Hard): Nested Loops and Breaks - Find Pairs
# Explanation: Create a program that finds all pairs of numbers (i, j) such that i + j is a target sum (e.g., 10) within a range of 1 to n.
# - Use nested `for` loops to find all pairs.
# - Break out of the inner loop once a valid pair is found to avoid duplicates.
# - Use a `for-else` construct to handle cases where no pair is found.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter the range (n): 10
# Enter the target sum: 10
# Example Output:
# Pairs with sum 10: [(1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6)]
