# Topic Recap: Lists

# 3 Easy Exercises

# Exercise 1 (Easy): List of Squares
# Explanation: Write a Python program that creates a list of squares from 1 to n (where n is a user input).
# Guidance: Use a `for` loop and the `append()` method to add squares to the list.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter the value of n: 5
# Example Output:
# List of squares from 1 to 5: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


# Exercise 2 (Easy): Find the Maximum in a List
# Explanation: Write a Python program that finds and prints the maximum number in a given list of integers.
# Guidance: Use the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum number.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# (No input required)
# Example Output:
# Maximum number in the list: 9


# Exercise 3 (Easy): Remove Duplicates from a List
# Explanation: Write a Python program that removes duplicates from a list of integers.
# Guidance: Use a loop and the `in` operator to check for duplicates.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# (No input required)
# Example Output:
# List without duplicates: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


# 2 Medium Exercises

# Exercise 4 (Medium): List Reversal
# Explanation: Write a program that reverses a list without using the built-in `reverse()` method or slicing.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# (No input required)
# Example Output:
# Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


# Exercise 5 (Medium): Merge and Sort Two Lists
# Explanation: Write a program that takes two lists of numbers, merges them into one list, and sorts the resulting list in ascending order.
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# (No input required)
# Example Output:
# Merged and sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]


# 1 Hard Exercise

# Exercise 6 (Hard): Rotating a List
# Explanation: Create a program that rotates a list to the right by a specified number of steps.
# - For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 2 steps, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
# Solution:


# Example Input:
# Enter the number of steps to rotate: 2
# Example Output:
# Rotated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
