# 3 Easy Exercises

# Exercise 1 (Easy): Sort List of Numbers
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted Numbers: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]


# Exercise 2 (Easy): Sort Data Alphabetically
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_data` that takes a list of strings representing data entries and returns a new list with the entries sorted alphabetically using `sorted()`.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted Data Entries: ['BI Specialist', 'Data Engineer', 'Data Scientist', 'ML Engineer']


# Exercise 3 (Easy): Sort Data in Reverse Order
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_reverse` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in descending order using the `sorted()` function.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted Numbers in Descending Order: [10, 8, 5, 3]


# 2 Medium Exercises

# Exercise 4 (Medium): Sort List of Dictionaries by Key
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_records` that takes a list of dictionaries representing employee records, each containing 'name' and 'age' keys, and returns a new list sorted by 'age' in ascending order using `sorted()`.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted Records by Age: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}]


# Exercise 5 (Medium): Sort and Filter Data
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_and_filter_sales` that takes a list of tuples representing sales data (product_name, sales_amount) and returns a sorted list of products with sales over 100, in descending order by sales amount.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted and Filtered Sales Data: [('Laptop', 150), ('Tablet', 120)]


# 1 Hard Exercise

# Exercise 6 (Hard): Sort Nested Lists by Column
# Explanation: Write a function `sort_nested_lists` that takes a nested list representing a dataset (e.g., [[ID, Name, Age], ...]) and sorts the list by a specified column index. The function should:
# - Take two arguments: the nested list and the column index to sort by.
# - Return the sorted nested list.
# Solution:


# Example Output:
# Sorted Data by Age: [[2, 'Bob', 25], [1, 'Alice', 30], [3, 'Charlie', 35]]
